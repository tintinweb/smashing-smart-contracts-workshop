# Smashing Smart Contracts: Automated Vulnerability Detection and Exploitation

In this workshop we'll practice hacking & exploitation of Solidity/EVM smart contracts. During the workshop we'll solve challenges from [CaptureTheEther](https://capturetheether.com) and [OpenZeppelin Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com) usign [Mythril](https://github.com/ConsenSys/mythril) and [Scrooge McEtherface](https://github.com/b-mueller/scrooge-mcetherface/) and do a little frontrunning exercise. The flattened source code for all challenges is available in the [code directory](./code).

Check out the [DEF CON 27 writeup](https://github.com/b-mueller/smashing-smart-contracts/blob/master/DEFCON27-EVM-Smart-Contracts-Mueller-Luca.pdf) for some background.

## Preparation

Here's how to get set up for the workshop. It should be super easy except if you're using Windows (you need Node.js and a Python 3 environment).

If you run into insurmountable problems ask the instructors for help. There's also a dedicated [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/AQZu4jN) that we created exclusively for you, the valued workshop participant.

### Installing Ganache

[Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) is a local Ethereum development server. Install it with npm:

```console
$ npm i -g ganache-cli
```

### Installing Mythril (Vulnerability Detection)

Install [Mythril](https://github.com/ConsenSys/mythril) from Pypi:

```bash
$ pip3 install mythril
```

If you can't get this to work you can use the Docker image instead (see [docs](https://mythril-classic.readthedocs.io/en/master/installation.html), note however that the below tools won't work then.

Mythril uses solc to compile Solidity files, so you'll need to [install that as well](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing-solidity.html#binary-packages).

### Installing Scrooge McEtherface (Exploit Automation)

To install Scrooge, clone the [Github repo](https://github.com/b-mueller/scrooge-mcetherface/) to install the required packages into a Python 3 environment:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/b-mueller/scrooge-mcetherface
$ cd scrooge-mcetherface
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Setup `config.ini` for Ganache:

```
[settings]
rpc = http://localhost:7545
sender = 0xf4a60CbD6C43418c71389d8a0D98a9A356609761
symbolic_tx_count = 3
timeout = 300
gasprice = 3000000000
```

### Installing Theo (Frontrunning)

Theo has a PyPI package:
```console
$ pip install --user theo --upgrade
```

Or you can just clone the repo and install it:
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/cleanunicorn/theo
$ cd theo
$ pip install -e .
```

## Workshop Content and Exercises

### Level 1: Accidentally Killin'

In the first example we'll focus on killing smart contracts as well as stealing Ether from them. Here are a few hints:

```
$ myth analyze <codefile.sol>
```

For analysis of on-chain contracts use the `--rpc` and `-a` options.

```
$ myth analyze --rpc localhost:8545 -a <address>
$ myth analyze --rpc infura-ropsten -a <address>
```

To run Scrooge McEtherface, set up Scrooge's `config.ini`, then run:

```
$ ./scrooge <address>
```

**Target Contracts:**

- [Guess the Random Number](./code/RandomNumber.sol) - [Challenge on CTE](https://capturetheether.com/challenges/lotteries/guess-the-random-number/)
- [Ethernaut Fallout](./code/Fallout.sol) - [Challenge on Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/level/0x220beee334f1c1f8078352d88bcc4e6165b792f6)
- [Ethernaut Fallback](./code/Fallback.sol) - [Challenge on Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/level/0x234094aac85628444a82dae0396c680974260be7)

### Level 2: Integer Arithmetics

In the second example we'll again steal tokens and Ether, but this time with an integer arithmetics flavor.

- [Ethernaut Token](./code/Token.sol) - [Challenge on Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/level/0x6545df87f57d21cb096a0bfcc53a70464d062512)
- [Tokensale on CaptureTheEther](./code/TokenSale.sol) - [Challenge on CTE](https://capturetheether.com/challenges/math/token-sale/)

### Level 3: Honeypot

This time, we'll set up a honeypot for others to tap into ([VulnerableTwoStep](./code/VulnerableTwoStep.sol)).

To run Theo, start it with available arguments:
```console
$ theo
The account's private key (input hidden)
> 
Contract to interact with
> 0x1df62f291b2e969fb0849d99d9ce41e2f137006e
Scanning for exploits in contract: 0x1dF62f291b2E969fB0849d99D9Ce41e2F137006e
Received an empty response from eth_getCode. Check the contract address and verify that you are on the correct chain.
No exploits found. You're going to need to load some exploits.

Tools available in the console:
- `exploits` is an array of loaded exploits found by Mythril or read from a file
- `w3` an initialized instance of web3py for the provided HTTP RPC endpoint
- `dump()` writing a json representation of an object to a local file

Check the readme for more info:
https://github.com/cleanunicorn/theo

Theo version v0.8.1.

```
**Protip:**

To be safe from frontrunning and errors, wrap your exploit into a wrapper that reverts the transaction if the attack fails:

```
contract Wrapper {
    
	_target = 0xaAaAaAaaAaAaAaaAaAAAAAAAAaaaAaAaAaaAaaAa

    constructor(bytes memory _data) public payable {
        address proxy = address(this);
        uint256 start_balance = msg.sender.balance + proxy.balance;
        
        address(_target).call.value(msg.value)(_data);
        
        assert(msg.sender.balance + proxy.balance > start_balance);
        selfdestruct(msg.sender);
    }
     
    function() external payable {}
}
```

## Advanced Setup

### Running a Geth Light Client

Most of the examples work with [Infura](https://www.infura.io), but if you want to use Scrooge McEtherface and do things in a block-chainy way you should run your own node. Syncing a full node can take a couple of days but you can set up a light client instead. Install [go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Installing-Geth) and run:

```
geth --testnet --syncmode light --rpc
```

This should sync with the Ropsten network pretty quickly. You can now point Metamask and Scrooge to `Localhost 8545`.


### Getting Testnet ETH

First, you need a web3 capable browser and some testnet ETH. You probably also have both, but if not, get [Metamask](https://metamask.io) and grab some ETH from the Ropsten faucets:

- https://faucet.metamask.io/
- https://faucet.ropsten.be/

## Troubleshooting

### openssl/aes.h: No such file or directory

If you get this error, you need the libssl source libraries:

```
    scrypt-1.2.1/libcperciva/crypto/crypto_aes.c:6:10: fatal error: openssl/aes.h: No such file or directory
     #include <openssl/aes.h>
              ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    compilation terminated.
    error: command 'x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc' failed with exit status 1
    
    ----------------------------------------
Command "/usr/bin/python3 -u -c "import setuptools, tokenize;__file__='/tmp/pip-build-5rl4ep94/scrypt/setup.py';f=getattr(tokenize, 'open', open)(__file__);code=f.read().replace('\r\n', '\n');f.close();exec(compile(code, __file__, 'exec'))" install --record /tmp/pip-mnbzx9qe-record/install-record.txt --single-version-externally-managed --compile" failed with error code 1 in /tmp/pip-build-5rl4ep94/scrypt/
```

On Ubuntu you can install them with:
```console
$ sudo apt install libssl-dev
```

### mythril - Solc has experienced a fatal error (code 1).

This error may occur if the solidity compiler `solc` installed in path is incompatible with the provided source code (e.g. installed version is `0.5.x` but smart contract requires `<=0.4.x`)
```
$ myth analyze <contract_0_4_x.sol>

mythril.interfaces.cli [ERROR]: Solc has experienced a fatal error (code 1).

code/RandomNumber.sol:8:1: Error: Source file requires different compiler version (current compiler is 0.5.3+commit.10d17f24.Darwin.appleclang - note that nightly builds are considered to be strictly less than the released version
contract GuessTheRandomNumberChallenge {
^------^

SolidityVersionMismatch: Try adding the option "--solv <version_number>"
```

There's a few options how to resolve this:

* Either try using `--solv <solidity_version>` as suggested
* Or force mythril to use a user-provide `solc` binary to comiple the code as follows:

```console
$ export SOLC=/usr/local/bin/solc-0.4.26
$ myth analyze <contract_0_4_x.sol>
```

## What to Do Next

A great way to continue learning is playing challenges like [Capture the Ether](https://capturetheether.com), [Security Innovation CTF](https://blockchain-ctf.securityinnovation.com) and [Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.zeppelin.solutions).
